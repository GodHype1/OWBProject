# OWBProject

This repo contains the project that needs to be delivered by the end of august

First init.
We need to have the ability to add pictures as NFT's (see line 102 in NonFungibleToken.cdc)
-> //Minting an NFT should be going the course of 'uploading' a picture and creating an NFT with it. Adding this NFT to your photo-collection which afterwards can be rated.

After we add the pictures, there should be a time at which voting commences to see who has the best photo-collection. Voting will commence after which the person with the highest amount of votes needs to receive a token.
